They are an unlikely pair: George is ""small and quick and dark of face""; Lennie, a man of tremendous size, has the mind of a young child.

Laborers in California's dusty vegetable fields, they hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. But George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own.While the powerlessness of the laboring class is a recurring theme in Steinbeck's work of the late 1930s, he narrowed his focus when composing 'Of Mice and Men' (1937), creating an intimate portrait of two men facing a world marked by petty tyranny, misunderstanding, jealousy, and callousness. But though the scope is narrow, the theme is universal: a friendship and a shared dream that makes an individual's existence meaningful.A unique perspective on life's hardships, this story has achieved the status of timeless classic due to its remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films.","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'School', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Read For School', 'Novels']",3.88,2396235,0142000671,2002.0,John Steinbeck,Penguin Books,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0142000671.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,both,0.07017543859649122,Negative

book_53,the grapes of wrath,"The Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression, a book that galvanized‚Äîand sometimes outraged‚Äîmillions of readers.First published in 1939, Steinbeck‚Äôs Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression chronicles the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s and tells the story of one Oklahoma farm family, the Joads‚Äîdriven from their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California. Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man‚Äôs fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman‚Äôs stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck‚Äôs powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics.","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'School', 'American']",4.0,864334,0808514202,1999.0,John Steinbeck,Sagebrush Bound,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0808514202.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,both,0.12182539682539681,Positive

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.","['Science Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'War']",4.31,1309236,0812589041,1999.0,Orson Scott Card,Tor Books,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0812589041.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,both,-0.011222222222222212,Negative

book_78,gifts of the nile: ancient egyptian faience,"One of the ancient world's most beautiful forms of ceramic is today known as Egyptian faience. The ancient Egyptians named it tjehnet, meaning that which is brilliant or scintillating, and in their eyes it glistened with symbolic light. Although faience was made of common materials, especially quartz sand grains or crushed quartz pebbles, it nevertheless took on the splendor of gold or semiprecious gems. The creative variety was astonishing: from 36,000 faience tiles lining underground rooms in King Djoser's Third Dynasty Step Pyramid complex to tiny plaques for furniture inlay, from jewelry to statuary, from female fertility objects to perfume containers, amulets, inkwells, animal tomb gifts, mummy masks, and a host of other forms. This is the first publication to analyze fully the significance of faience in ancient Egypt, and to present the most marvelous examples of its creation. Under the skilled editorship of Florence Friedman, the world's leading scholars in the field--from the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Cleveland Museum of Art; the British Museum; and elsewhere--show how faience was used and produced, as well as its symbolic values and meanings. More than 150 pieces, drawn from public and private collections around the world, are reproduced in color and described in detail. This dazzling display looks at the origins of faience, and at its use in royal life, in daily life, and in connection with death and rebirth.

He was laying on his hard, as it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his domelike brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes.""

A harrowing‚Äîthough absurdly comic‚Äîmeditation on human feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, The Metamorphosis has taken its place as one of the most widely read and influential works of twentieth-century fiction.
